                Once the module is installed, you will notice a new menu item called "Approval Settings" that will be
                added. In this view, you will find a comprehensive summary displaying the number of predefined approval
                roles and the total count of created approval routes.

            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the interface provides convenient quick action buttons to facilitate the process of adding
                new approval roles or routes. This allows you to easily expand the approval functionality according to
                your specific requirements.
            </p>

            <h2>Predefined Approval Roles</h2>
            <p>
                "Predefined Approval Roles" allow you to designate specific employees as persistent approvers for
                various documents, such as Purchase Orders, Sale Orders, Expense Reports, Payments and more.
                With this feature, you can easily set up predefined roles, ensuring that certain individuals
                consistently handle approvals for specific document types.
            </p>
            <img class="oe_screenshot" src="predefined_approval_roles.png" alt="Predefined Approval Roles"
                 width="100%"/>
            </p>

            <h2>Creating Approval Role</h2>
            <p>To add a new role, you need to enter the role's name, select one or multiple users, and choose the
                company for which this role is relevant.</p>
            <p>
                <img class="oe_screenshot" src="predefined_approval_role_form.png" alt="Predefined Approval Role Form"
                     width="100%"/>
            </p>
            <p>If multiple users are specified, the document can be approved by any of them, or the system will request
                approval from all specified users, depending on the approval cycle settings. Selecting a company will
                allow you to create identical roles if you have multiple companies set up and you are using the "Multi
                Company" functionality.</p>

            <h2>Creating Approval Route</h2>
            <p>
                The creation of approval routes enables the establishment of flexible and dynamic rules to generate a
                list of users who must sequentially approve a document for it to be considered fully approved.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this module, you can add an unlimited number of stages, each with multiple custom conditions. To
                include a user in the approval cycle, the system can evaluate factors such as the document's total
                amount, the selected partner, company, country, or specific products and analytical accounts used.
                Another noteworthy feature of the module is the ability to specify custom conditions using Python code
                to add an approver to the approval cycle.
            </p>

        <div class="col-12">
            <p>
                Here is some example of PO approval route:
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 6 stages in this approval route. But only the "Supply Manager" stage was added without any
                custom conditions. It means that the supply manager is responsible for approving all purchase orders
                initiated using this approval route.
            </p>
            <p>

                     width="100%"/>
            </p>
            <p>For other employees to approve a purchase order, specific conditions must be met:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Manager</strong>: The Product Manager should approve the purchase order if it
                    contains particular products in the order lines.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Marketing Department Manager</strong>: The Marketing Department Manager should approve the
                    purchase order if the order lines are associated with the analytic account "Commercial & Marketing."
                </li>
                <li><strong>R&D Department Manager</strong>: The R&D Department Manager should approve the purchase
                    order if the order lines are associated with the analytic account "Research & Development."
                </li>
                <li><strong>Accountant</strong>: The Accountant should approve purchase orders with a total amount equal
                    to or greater than 1000 USD.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Financial Director</strong>: The Financial Director will be requested to approve purchase
                    orders with a total amount equal to or greater than 100,000 USD.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As you have noticed, the conditions are highly flexible, allowing for the coverage of various business
                requirements for the approval system. Additionally, this is not an exhaustive list of conditions; the
                route generation can be further customized based on various criteria as needed.
            </p>
            <h2>Selective Field Locking</h2>
            <p>
                The Selective Field Locking functionality allows users to designate specific document fields that will
                remain locked for changes after the document has been sent for approval or has received approval from at
                least one participant.
            </p>
            <p>If user tries to change document, he/she will see error message.</p>

                     width="100%"/>
            </p>
            <h2>Creating Approval Workflow</h2>
            <p>To create a new approval workflow, follow these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter a name for the workflow.</li>
                <li>Select the data model for which this workflow will be applied.</li>
                <li>Specify the users responsible for managing and keeping this workflow up-to-date.</li>
                <li>Add approval stages</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Adding Approval Stage</h2>
            <p>To add a new stage you need to click "Add New Stage".</p>
            <p>Here is how the form looks like:</p>
            <p><img class="oe_screenshot" src="approval_stage_form_conditions.png"
                    alt="Dynamic Approval Stage Conditions"
                    width="100%"/></p>
            <h4>Stage Title</h4>
            <p>Name for approval stage</p>
            <h4>Approval Type</h4>
            <p>There are two options available: "At least one approver" and "All approvers."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "At least one approver" implies that approval from a minimum of one person is sufficient to consider
                    the approval stage as completed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "All approvers" requires that the document must receive approval from all approvers assigned to the
                    approval stage for it to be considered fully approved.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Approvers (Predefined)</h4>
            <p>Here a predefined approval role can be selected.</p>
            <h4>Approvers (Custom)</h4>
            <p>
                This field is to specify custom approvers for the stage. If there is no predefined role, you can select
                any user as approver. Please do not forget to grant user access to the associated module. Also, here you
                can select multiple users.
            </p>
            <p>
                The option to select multiple users who can approve a document offers several advantages in managing the
                approval process:
            </p>
            <p>
                Vacation or Leave Coverage: If one of the designated approvers is on vacation or leave, another
                authorized approver from the selected group can handle the approval. This ensures that the document
                approval process remains uninterrupted even in the absence of certain users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shared Responsibility: By spreading the responsibility among multiple employees, the burden of approvals
                can be distributed more evenly. This not only helps prevent bottlenecks but also promotes a more
                efficient and timely approval workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having this feature in place adds flexibility and resilience to the approval system, contributing to
                smoother operations and improved collaboration within the organization.
            </p>
            <h4>Amount</h4>
            <p>
                In this settings group, you can choose the field containing the monetary amount and specify the
                condition under which an approval stage will be added to the document.
            </p>
            <h4>Partners</h4>
            <p>
                Here, you can choose the field containing partner and select partners and specify a condition for adding
                an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with, or not associated with, the
                chosen partners.
            </p>
            <h4>Countries</h4>
            <p>
                Here, you can choose the field containing country and select countries and specify a condition for
                adding an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with, or not associated with,
                the chosen countries.
            </p>
            <h4>Companies</h4>
            <p>
                Here, you can choose the field containing company and select companies and specify a condition for
                adding an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with, or not associated with,
                the chosen companies
            </p>
            <h4>Products</h4>
            <p>
                That group of settings is to choose the field containing product(s) and select products and specify a
                condition for adding an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with, or not
                associated with, the chosen products.
            </p>
            <h4>Analytic Accounts</h4>
            <p>
                That group of settings is to choose the field containing analytic account(s) and select accounts and
                specify a condition for adding an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with,
                or not associated with, the chosen accounts
            </p>
            <h4>Custom Condition Code</h4>
            <p>
                You have the option to enter a Python expression to define a custom condition for including or excluding
                an approver from the document approval workflow. This allows for greater flexibility and customization
                in the approval process based on specific business requirements.

                It is essential to note that the ability to select any data model doesn't mean the approval process will
                be automatically implemented for those types of documents.

                The base module contains abstract methods designed for further extending Odoo's functionality. The list
                of sub-modules intended for use with this base module is limited but will gradually expand. In the Odoo
                store and through the links below, you will find a list of sub-modules that enhance the built-in
                functionality of Odoo by leveraging the capabilities of the base module.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have in-house programmers, after acquiring this module, they can apply this base module to your
                system by implementing the specific functionality under a dedicated module. This approach allows for the
                gradual customization and extension of the approval workflow to suit your organization's unique
                requirements.

                Please note that to send email notifications to approvers
                an outgoing email server should be configured.

                If your Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) supports SRS (Sender Rewriting Scheme), your users can send and
                receive notification.
                However, that is more complex and requires more technical knowledge.
